# TradFi Format

A decentralized platform for standardizing and tokenizing traditional financial instruments on the Stacks blockchain, enabling seamless digital representation of financial assets.

## Overview

TradFi Format is a decentralized platform that enables financial institutions and investors to:
- Tokenize and standardize traditional financial instruments
- Create digital representations of complex financial assets
- Enable fractional ownership and increased liquidity
- Implement compliance and regulatory checks programmatically

## Architecture

The platform consists of several key smart contracts that work together:

### Asset Registry
The core contract that manages financial instrument metadata, ownership, and compliance tracking. Features include:
- Financial instrument registration and metadata management
- Regulatory compliance checks
- Asset ownership and transfer capabilities
- Fractional ownership support

### Financial Marketplace
Handles the economic aspects of the platform, including:
- Asset trading and liquidity provision
- Automated royalty and dividend distribution
- Secure transaction escrow
- Multiple investment models (direct ownership, fractional shares, derivatives)

### Instrument Licensing
Manages the legal and regulatory framework for financial instruments:
- Multiple regulatory compliance types (SEC, FINRA, International)
- Investor accreditation verification
- Usage and transfer restrictions
- Cross-border investment capabilities

### Reputation System
Tracks the reputation and reliability of templates and developers:
- User and template ratings
- Review management
- Usage statistics
- Purchase verification

### Governance
Enables community-driven platform evolution through:
- Proposal creation and voting
- Parameter updates
- Platform policy changes
- Weighted voting based on platform participation

## Smart Contract Interface

### Template Registry

```clarity
;; Register a new template
(define-public (register-template
    (title (string-ascii 50))
    (description (string-ascii 500))
    (tags (list 5 (string-ascii 20)))
    (documentation-url (optional (string-ascii 100)))
    (repository-url (optional (string-ascii 100)))
    (clarity-versions (list 5 (string-ascii 10)))
    (platforms (list 3 (string-ascii 20)))
) => (response uint bool))

;; Publish a new template version
(define-public (publish-template-version
    (template-id uint)
    (version (string-ascii 10))
    (content-hash (buff 32))
    (release-notes (string-ascii 200))
) => (response bool uint))
```

### Marketplace

```clarity
;; Purchase a template
(define-public (purchase-template 
    (template-id uint)
) => (response bool uint))

;; Create escrow payment
(define-public (create-escrow-payment 
    (template-id uint)
) => (response uint uint))
```

### License Management

```clarity
;; Create a new license
(define-public (create-license
    (license-type uint)
    (name (string-utf8 50))
    (description (string-utf8 500))
    (attribution-required bool)
    (modification-allowed bool)
    (commercial-use-allowed bool)
    (fee uint)
) => (response uint uint))
```

### Reputation System

```clarity
;; Submit a review
(define-public (submit-review 
    (template-id uint)
    (rating uint)
    (review-text (string-utf8 500))
    (template-owner principal)
) => (response bool uint))
```

### Governance

```clarity
;; Create governance proposal
(define-public (create-proposal 
    (title (string-ascii 100))
    (description (string-utf8 1000))
    (function-name (string-ascii 128))
    (function-args (list 20 (string-utf8 100)))
    (voting-period-days uint)
) => (response uint uint))
```
